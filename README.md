## Requirements

- npm

## Installation

```

## Running Locally

Start the server using Node. The application listens on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable (defaults to `8080`).

```bash
node index.js
```

## Deployment

You can deploy the app to any Node.js hosting provider. When using [Render](https://render.com), create a new Web Service and set the start command to `node index.js`. Render will install dependencies using `npm install` and launch the server on the assigned port.
